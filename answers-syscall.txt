< Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
> usertrap()

< What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? 
< (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.) 
> 0x7. It is the index of the exec system call

<	What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
> The CPU was in user mode because the SPP bit in the sstatus register is
> set to 0

< Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which 
< register corresponds to the variable num?
> `lw	a3,0(zero)`. The variable num is stored in a3

< Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address
< 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in
< scause above? 
> It crashes because the kernel is trying to access address 0 which is not
> mapped to its virtual address space. scause contains a value of 0xd, which
> is interpreted as a Page Fault

< What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced?
< What is its process id (pid)?
> The binary was initcode and its pid 1
